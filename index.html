<h1>Hello, my name is Cristy Schneider.</h1>
<p>I am not really sure what I will identify as my hobby these days. With a full time job, studies, house chores, friends, family and church (not necessarily in order of my priorities), there's not a lot of time left for anything else. <br>
</p>
<p>I still make time for reading and recently I have been engrossed in de-cluttering and living a simple life. So one weekend, I went through my closet, so did my husband, and ended up donating a few bags of clothes to Salvation Army. The book that really encouraged me to alter the way I am consuming things this 2017 is a book called "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up" by Marie Kondo. You can find out more about her by visiting her website <a href="https://konmari.com/">https://konmari.com/</a><br></p>
